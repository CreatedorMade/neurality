# neurality
A simple neural networking library written in Java.

## What it does
Neurality is a simple way of creating and simulating neural networks in Java. All you need to do is write the code for your neurons, register them with the system, generate the networks and simulate them with your data. Neurality streamlines these processes, taking some control away from the programmer in exchange for ease of use. For more information see the wiki.
